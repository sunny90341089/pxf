<!--
  This file is required because initialization of HiveConf fails when it
  attempts to find the file in the classloader, then in HIVE_CONF_DIR, then
  HIVE_HOME, and finally it tries to find the file in the parent directory
  of the jar "new File(new File(jarUri).getParentFile(), nameInConf)".
  However, because the jar is an "opaque" jar (A URI is opaque if, and only if,
  it is absolute and its scheme-specific part does not begin with a slash
  character ('/'). An opaque URI has a scheme, a scheme-specific part, and
  possibly a fragment; all other components are undefined) the `File(jarUri)`
  call throws an IllegalArgumentException which causes the HiveConf class to
  completely fail to load. Adding this file, allows the `findConfigFile` method
  in HiveConf find the desired file by doing `classLoader.getResource(name)`
  and it prevents going to the failing branch of the code.
